Filed.com: audio file CRUD (flask server + angular UI) 


This test only specified the tech stack for api: flask and Database:Mongodb. I have taken the liberty to use angular for UI.

To run the project:
1. clone the repo
2. run server.py using the given command: "py server.py"
3. start the angular application from FileUI folder using the given command: "npm start"
4. the project will run in http//localhost:4200

There is also a screen recording of the project for a quick look: FiledFlaskAngularMongoDb.webm


Incase of missing packages error:
Please run "npm install" after deleting the node_modules folder
